## Ambher-Backend-Phase-1


### Steps to run the server at your local
1. Run `npm i`
> This will setup node modules at your system.
2. In the root directory of the project execute `npm run dev`
> This will start the server at `Port-5000`.


#### Requirement
1. Node.js.
2. npm package manager.
3. Port-**5000** should be free.


#### Coding Guidelines
1. Always get your code **reviewed** before merging it into the **master** branch.
2. Always create a new branch for a task, **never** commit directly into **master** branch.
> New branch can be created using: `git checkout -b <New Branch Name>`
3. Always use **camel-casing** for variable naming and **upper camel-casing**(preferred) for function, class naming.
```
const FooBar = () => {} // Upper Camel-casing for functions
const fooBar = 5; // Lower camel-casing for variables.
```
4. Use under-score casing/snake casing for file/folder namings.
5. Make use of `let` and `const` only. Use of `var` is prohibited.
6. Make use of arrow functions wherever possible(use `function` keyboard when extremely required).
7. Use tab size of **2**.
8. Always format your code and use semi-colons.
9. Always enclose your router definition in a try catch block and always use async-await.
```
router.post('/', middleware, async(req, res) => {
    try{
        ...
    }catch(err){
        ...
    }
})
```
10. Always break your code into smaller chunks to avoid complexity.
11. Always comment your code wherever required(where you feel, it might be difficult for someone else to understand).
12. Always write business logic on controller, no logic should come in router.


*** Code will be deployed on a bi-weekly cycle on Fridays after the hosting configurations are all set***
